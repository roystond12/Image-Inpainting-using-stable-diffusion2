Hi, this is Royston here!

This is the third project I have worked on, titled "Image Inpainting using Stable Diffusion 2". This project was developed as part of my Semester 5 mini-project.

We are using the Stable Diffusion 2 model, and the framework is built using Gradio.

I hope you had a great time visiting my GitHub account. Thank you!
